Hey, hold on! How am I to use this?
-----------------------------------

Ah, yes! Log in with your Facebook account. You'll be shown a page with three text fields where you need to enter your Friends' names. Friend suggestions will popup as and when you type a name in the field. 

* **Person A** - 'We're fighting for' - The one for which we're battling
* **Person B and C** - 'First Person' and 'Second Person' - Two persons who battle for Person A.

The app compares B with A, C with A and tells you the one who it feels is the best match for A. 

After I find out who's the best?
--------------------------------

You'll be prompted to **post the result in your Facebook Wall.** You may choose to do it or avoid it.
